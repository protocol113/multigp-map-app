# Drone Racing Course Planner

This is a cross-platform mobile app that lets you place a properly scaled drone racing course over a satellite image of your planned site. This tool helps people plan out layouts from different track designs and enables them to make informed planning decisions prior to race day.

## Project Outline

### Primary Objectives
1. Build a cross-platform mobile app for Android and IOS.
2. Utilize Google's satellite imagery API.
3. Allow course designers to build complicated tracks and import courses from an existing pool of tracks using measurements provided by Multigp to determine placement of track components.
4. Enable users to save and share tracks.

### Additional Objectives
1. Build an AI training dataset that will generate tracks for a given field size.
2. Ensure the app is responsive.
3. Develop a functioning prototype within two weeks.

### Target Audience
The target audience for this app is FPV drone racing pilots who are already familiar with track layouts and building. This tool is meant to assist pilots with planning and sharing tracks with other pilots.

### Current Market
There are currently no apps that provide this specific functionality, making this app unique in the drone racing market.
